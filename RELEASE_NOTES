AB WT Analysis Pipeline 1.2 Release notes.

Release 1.2.1

	Fixes a bug in count_tags.pl where counts were doubled when 
	-read_alignment_type is set to 'top_score'
	
	Fixes a bug in split_read_mapper.sh where filtered reads were reported
	in the gff file.
	
	Fixing a problem in split_read_mapper.sh where insufficient memory
	is requested for scheduled jobs.
	
	Fixes a problem in split_read_mapper.sh where determination of unique
	reads is done differently for .max and .gff results.
	
	Fixes a problem in split_read_mapper.sh where references with a large
	number of sequence entries cause failure with the message 'Too many open
	Files' during the Reference Partitioning step.
	
	Adding default 'queue.sys.resource.string' to etc/config.ini for LSF and 
	SGE schedulers.

Release 1.2

   Split read mapping algorithm can place reads across known and putative 
   splice junctions
   
   Exon boundaries provided by GTF input file

   split_read_mapper.sh now uses the cascading configuration files implemented
   in ntr_finder.sh
   
   In extension, a valid adjacent mismatch now lowers the score by 2.  In prior
   releases a valid adjacent mismatch lowers the score by 1.

Release 1.1

   Fixes a problem in schema_26_2_adj and possibly other schemas.  These 
   problems resulted in missing mappings in version 1.0.

   Sun Grid Engine (SGE) is now a supported as a scheduler.

   Added bin/ntr_finder.sh, a tool for identifying novel transcribed regions.

   Many new schemas added to etc/schemas.  These new schemas feature 
   additional mapping configurations or improved performance over schemas 
   in release 1.0.

   Shebang(#!) Line in python scripts is no longer used.  Python is now 
   called directly.

   Fixes some bugs in mapping where reads were not properly mapped to 
   reference containing IUB codes.

   count_tags.pl sets the name field in individual chromosome wig files, 
   allowing loading multiple files in UCSC browser.

   Fixes a problem in count_tags.pl where reference sequence description 
   lines containing whitespace caused no counts to be reported.

   Fixes a problem in the gff output of count_tags.pl where the strand and phase
   columns were swapped.  Column 7 is now strand and Column 8 is now phase.

Release 1.0  

   Initial Release

Known Issues

   count_tags.pl will fail if reference has more than 50 sequence entry, 
   and is_sorted = no and -split_by_chromosome = yes.  


   Mapping with MATCHES_TO_IUPACS_VALID_FOR_MAPPING_AND_EXTENSION is not 
   guaranteed to report zero mismatches for a read mapped to a perfectly 
   aligning reference containing IUB codes.  This feature is under development.

   Mapping tasks will fail if user specifies a mapping configuration for 
   which there is no corresponding schema file in etc/schemas.  Is this case, 
   the user will receive an error like: �Schema file schema_##_# could not be 
   found.�  Missing schemas may be available through support.

   Job monitoring requires $PS4 to be '+'.  When checking for successful 
   completion of jobs, the program looks for a line starting with '+ RETVAL=1"  
   However, the '+' part of this is set by the $PS4 environment variable.  
   If $PS4 is not �+�, the program will fail.

   Repeating a run of the pipeline will fail with a different setting for
   VALID_ADJACENT_MISMATCHES_COUNT_AS_ONE_FOR_MAPPING_AND_EXTENSION. You 
   must manually remove the max files from 
   <FOLDER_FOR_OUTPUT_FILES>/tmp/mappingAndExtension/reads_*/ref_*/
